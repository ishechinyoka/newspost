<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The <em>Newspost</em> is a news compilation and posting utility. It
uses material on the clipboard to create articles and place them into
designated categories.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The newspost utility is called <code>post</code> on the command-line.
It does two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create news articles using content on the clipboard; and</li>
<li>Compile those articles into an ebook for circulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>As to which function is evoked depends on how it is called:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call <code>post</code> without any arguments to have it compile all
the available news drafts in a preset category list. The list of
categories is up to you, but you should provide it in the
<code>NP_CATEGORIES</code> environment variable. This is what will be
read by the Newspost utility. Otherwise, when you pass in the -a or
–add-to option, provide the name of the category which you want to add
an article to. More below.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="creating-articles">Creating Articles</h1>
<p>To create article with <code>post</code>, simply copy any article of
interest from the web.</p>
<p><code>post</code> will simply decide what form of a draft is to be
created based on its format. Hence, there are two types of articles that
<code>post</code> can create:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single article; and</li>
<li>A collection of articles saved in one draft.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="formatting-articles">Formatting Articles</h3>
<p><code>post</code> uses the first two lines of the content on the
clipboard to decide how it has to be formatted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By default, if an article has its source as a website listed, for
example <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> articles are usually
shown as “bbc.co.uk”, then the article is treated as an individual
article. Otherwise, articles copied in groups from the Feedbro
Newsreader will have pipes like this: “| | |”</p>
<p>Regardless of which type of article is being created,
<code>post</code> needs to know where to place it. This is known as
classifying or categorising it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="article-categories">Article categories</h2>
<p>Every news periodical has got categories which are useful to classify
articles. This makes navigation through the periodical really
convenient.</p>
<p>It is an error if <code>post</code> is evoked to add an article
without providing a category where the article is to be placed. Hence,
<code>post --add-to zimbabwe</code></p>
<p>will add a new article, whether singly or in groups, to the Zimbabwe
category. Case does not matter. So typing,</p>
<p><code>post --add-to World</code></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>post --add-to world</code></p>
<p>is just the same. The article will be added to the <em>World</em>
category.</p>
<h3 id="where-are-category-files-located">Where are category files
located?</h3>
<p>On your hard drive, simply choose a directory to hold your articles.
We call this the <em>news directory</em>.You can then make post know
about this directory by setting the <code>NP_NEWSDIR</code> environment
variable in the <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code> file.</p>
<p>The <code>NP_NEWSDIR</code> contains two directories, one for holding
the individual articles and the other for holding semi-drafts: so the
<code>NP_NEWSDIR</code> has the “articles” and “drafts” as
subdirectories:</p>
<dl>
<dt>articles</dt>
<dd>
This should hold subdirectories representing your news categories.
</dd>
<dt>drafts</dt>
<dd>
This holds a list of articles in draft form. When news articles are
pasted from the clipboard in groups, they are stored in this directory.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the <code>articles</code> directory, create subdirectories, each
representing a category. <code>post</code> will scan this directory for
any extra articles when compiling the final publication: it combines
material in the Drafts and the Articles directories.</p>
<p>You can also decide to save yourself some typing by coming up with
shortcuts for category names, e.g. “wrd” for <em>World</em> or “zw” for
<em>Zimbabwe.</em></p>
<p>More categories and shortcuts can be added or removed as needed in
the Articles directory. To make <code>post</code> know about these
categories, you edit the categorize function.</p>
<h2 id="posting">Posting</h2>
<p>Calling <code>post</code> without arguments will compile articles for
the preset categories. You can choose which are these preset categories.
But <code>post</code> will have each category formatted as the main
heading, with its articles as subheadings.</p>
<p>You can also choose to compile categories into an individual ebook by
just calling <code>post [list-of-categories]</code></p>
<p>For example, calling <code>post</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>post africa technology world</code></pre>
<p>will create an ebook with a list of the passed in categories. Just
make sure that the arguments you pass to post this way represent the
available categories.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h2>
<p><code>newspost</code> functions properly if certain environment
variables are set in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>
file.</p>
<p>Whilst the program comes with defaults:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The defaults make reference to certain locations that might not
be present on your system;</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to go with the defaults, make sure to create the
directories. <code>newspost</code> does not create missing directories,
neither does it suggest to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Though defaults are provided, <em>one other environment variable
is compulsory:</em> <code>newspost</code> will not run without it. The
<code>$NP_CATEGORIES</code> which lists the news categories must be set.
If not, you must always run <code>post</code> followed by a list of
categories every time. The variable is there only for convenience if you
just want to run <code>post</code> without arguments.</p>
<p>The following are the environment variables that
<code>newspost</code> uses:</p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>NP_HOME</dt>
<dd>
Where <code>newspost</code> stores its configuration files. Defaults to
the <code>$HOME/.npost/</code> directory.
</dd>
<dt>NP_NEWS_DIR</dt>
<dd>
The root directory of your news articles. This should house the
“articles” and “drafts” subdirectories. Defaults to
<code>$HOME/News/</code> directory.
</dd>
<dt>NP_CATEGORIES</dt>
<dd>
A preset list of categories that must be compiled as a unit. This is a
list that <code>post</code> uses. There is no default value for this
variable: it is an error if you do not set it.
</dd>
<dt>NP_NEWSPOST</dt>
<dd>
Where should the final epub bulletin be placed. If not set, it defaults
to <code>$HOME</code>, which means in your home directory.
</dd>
